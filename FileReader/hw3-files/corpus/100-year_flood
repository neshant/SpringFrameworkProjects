a
onehundredyear
flood
is
a
flood
event
that
has
a
1
probability
of
occurring
in
any
given
year
the
100year
flood
is
also
referred
to
as
the
1
flood
since
its
annual
exceedance
probability
is
11
for
river
systems
the
100year
flood
is
generally
expressed
as
a
flowrate
based
on
the
expected
100year
flood
flow
rate
the
flood
water
level
can
be
mapped
as
an
area
of
inundation
the
resulting
floodplain
map
is
referred
to
as
the
100year
floodplain
estimates
of
the
100year

probabilityedit
a
common
misunderstanding
exists
that
a
100year
flood
is
likely
to
occur
only
once
in
a
100year
period
in
fact
there
is
approximately
a
634
chance
of
one
or
more
100year
floods
occurring
in
any
100year
period
on
the
danube
river
at
passau
germany
the
actual
intervals
between
100year
floods
during
1501
to
2013
ranged
from
37
to
192
years5
the
probability
pe
that
one
or
more
floods
occurring
during
any
period
will
exceed
a
given
flood
threshold
can
be
expressed
using
the
binomial
distribution
as

where

period

25yr
and
so
forth
and
n
is
the
number
of
years
in
the
period
the
probability
of
exceedance
pe
is
also
described
as
the
natural
inherent
or
hydrologic
risk
of
failure67
however
the
expected
value
of
the
number
of
100year
floods
occurring
in
any
100year
period
is

etc
the
percent
chance
of
an
xyear
flood
occurring
in
a
single
year
can
be
calculated
by
dividing
100
by
x
a
similar
analysis
is
commonly
applied
to
coastal
flooding
or
rainfall
data
the
recurrence
interval
of
a
storm
is
rarely
identical
to
that
of
an
associated
riverine
flood
because
of
rainfall
timing
and
location
variations
among
different
drainage
basins
the
field
of
extreme
value
theory
was
created
to
model
rare
events
such
as
100year
floods
for
the
purposes
of
civil
engineering
this
theory
is
most
commonly
applied
to
the
maximum
or
minimum
observed
stream
flows
of
a
given
river
in
desert
areas
where
there
are
only
ephemeral
washes
this
method
is
applied
to
the
maximum
observed
rainfall
over
a
given
period
of
time
24hours
6hours
or
3hours
the
extreme
value
analysis
only
considers
the
most
extreme
event
observed
in
a
given
year
so
between
the
large
spring
runoff
and
a
heavy
summer
rain
storm
whichever
resulted
in
more
runoff
would
be
considered
the
extreme
event
while
the
smaller
event
would
be
ignored
in
the
analysis
even
though
both
may
have
been
capable
of
causing
terrible
flooding
in
their
own
right
statistical
assumptionsedit
there
are
a
number
of
assumptions
which
are
made
to
complete
the
analysis
which
determines
the
100year
flood
first
the
extreme
events
observed
in
each
year
must
be
independent
from
yeartoyear
in
other
words
the
maximum
river
flow
rate
from
1984
cannot
be
found
to
be
significantly
correlated
with
the
observed
flow
rate
in
1985
1985
cannot
be
correlated
with
1986
and
so
forth
the
second
assumption
is
that
the
observed
extreme
events
must
come
from
the
same
probability
distribution
function
the
third
assumption
is
that
the
probability
distribution
relates
to
the
largest
storm
rainfall
or
river
flow
rate
measurement
that
occurs
in
any
one
year
the
fourth
assumption
is
that
the
probability
distribution
function
is
stationary
meaning
that
the
mean
average
standard
deviation
and
maxmin
values
are
not
increasing
or
decreasing
over
time
this
concept
is
referred
to
as
stationarity78
the
first
assumption
is
often
but
not
always
valid
and
should
be
tested
on
a
case
by
case
basis
the
second
assumption
is
often
valid
if
the
extreme
events
are
observed
under
similar
climate
conditions
for
example
if
the
extreme
events
on
record
all
come
from
late
summer
thunder
storms
as
is
the
case
in
the
southwest
us
or
from
snow
pack
melting
as
is
the
case
in
northcentral
us
then
this
assumption
should
be
valid
if
however
there
are
some
extreme
events
taken
from
thunder
storms
others
from
snow
pack
melting
and
others
from
hurricanes
then
this
assumption
is
most
likely
not
valid
the
third
assumption
is
only
a
problem
when
trying
to
forecast
a
low
but
maximum
flow
event
for
example
an
event
smaller
than
a
2year
flood
since
this
is
not
typically
a
goal
in
extreme
analysis
or
in
civil
engineering
design
then
the
situation
rarely
presents
itself
the
final
assumption
about
stationarity
is
difficult
to
test
from
data
for
a
single
site
because
of
the
large
uncertainties
in
even
the
longest
flood
records5
see
next
section
more
broadly
substantial
evidence
of
climate
change
strongly
suggests
that
the
probability
distribution
is
also
changing9
and
that
managing
flood
risks
in
the
future
will
become
even
more
difficult10
the
simplest
implication
of
this
is
that
not
all
of
the
historical
data
are
or
can
be
considered
valid
as
input
into
the
extreme
event
analysis
probability
uncertaintyedit
when
these
assumptions
are
violated
there
is
an
unknown
amount
of
uncertainty
introduced
into
the
reported
value
of
what
the
100year
flood
means
in
terms
of
rainfall
intensity
or
flood
depth
when
all
of
the
inputs
are
known
the
uncertainty
can
be
measured
in
the
form
of
a
confidence
interval
for
example
one
might
say
there
is
a
95
chance
that
the
100year
flood
is
greater
than
x
but
less
than
y1
direct
statistical
analysis8
to
estimate
the
100year
riverine
flood
is
possible
only
at
the
relatively
few
locations
where
an
annual
series
of
maximum
instantaneous
flood
discharges
has
been
recorded
in
the
united
states
as
of
2014
taxpayers
have
supported
such
records
for
at
least
60
years
at
fewer
than
2600
locations
for
at
least
90
years
at
fewer
than
500
and
for
at
least
120
years
at
only
1111
for
comparison
the
total
area
of
the
nation
is
about
3800000
square
miles
9800000km2
so
there
are
perhaps
3000
stream
reaches
that
drain
watersheds
of
1000
square
miles
2600km2
and
300000
reaches
that
drain
10
square
miles
26km2
in
urban
areas
100year
flood
estimates
are
needed
for
watersheds
as
small
as
1
square
mile
26km2
for
reaches
without
sufficient
data
for
direct
analysis
100year
flood
estimates
are
derived
from
indirect
statistical
analysis
of
flood
records
at
other
locations
in
a
hydrologically
similar
region
or
from
other
hydrologic
models
similarly
for
coastal
floods
tide
gauge
data
exist
for
only
about
1450
sites
worldwide
of
which
only
about
950
have
added

the
global

center
since

highwater

at

germany
as
of
september
2012
much
longer
records
of
flood
elevations
exist
at
a
few
locations
around
the
world
such
as
the
danube
river
at
passau
germany
but
they
must
be
evaluated
carefully
for
accuracy
and
completeness
before
any
statistical
interpretation
for
an
individual
stream
reach
the
uncertainties
in
any
analysis
can
be
large
so
100year
flood
estimates
have
large
individual
uncertainties
for
most
stream
reaches524
for
the
largest
recorded
flood
at
any
specific
location
or
any
potentially
larger
event
the
recurrence
interval
always
is
poorly
known52024
spatial
variability
adds
more
uncertainty
because
a
flood
peak
observed
at
different
locations
on
the
same
stream
during
the
same
event
commonly
represents
a
different
recurrence
interval
at
each
location520
if
an
extreme
storm
drops
enough
rain
on
one
branch
of
a
river
to
cause
a
100year
flood
but
no
rain
falls
over
another
branch
the
flood
wave
downstream
from
their
junction
might
have
a
recurrence
interval
of
only
10
years
conversely
a
storm
that
produces
a
25year
flood
simultaneously
in
each
branch
might
form
a
100year
flood
downstream
during
a
time
of
flooding
news
accounts
necessarily
simplify
the
story
by
reporting
the
greatest
damage
and
largest
recurrence
interval
estimated
at
any
location
the
public
can
easily
and
incorrectly
conclude
that
the
recurrence
interval
applies
to
all
stream
reaches

the
