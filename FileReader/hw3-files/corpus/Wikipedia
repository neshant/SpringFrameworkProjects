the

that

a
team
at

attributed
this
slowing
of

to

a

also
meet

that

it
must

present
original

a
claim
that

likely
to
be
challenged
requires
a
reference
to
a
reliable
source
among
wikipedia
editors
this
is
often
phrased
as
verifiability
not
truth
to
express
the
idea
that
the
readers
not
the

are
ultimately
responsible
for
checking
the
truthfulness
of

and
making
their
own
interpretations89
this
can
at
times
lead
to
the
removal
of

finally

all

the
arbitration
committee
presides
over
the
ultimate
dispute
resolution
process
although
disputes
usually
arise
from
a
disagreement
between
two
opposing
views
on
how
an

should
read
the
arbitration
committee
explicitly
refuses
to
directly
rule
on
the
specific
view
that
should
be
adopted
statistical
analyses
suggest
that
the
committee
ignores
the
content
of
disputes
and
rather
focuses
on
the
way
disputes
are
conducted104
functioning
not
so
much
to
resolve
disputes
and
make
peace
between
conflicting
editors
but
to
weed
out
problematic
editors
while
allowing
potentially
productive
editors
back
in
to
participate
therefore
the
committee
does
not
dictate
the
content
of
articles
although
it
sometimes
condemns
content
changes
when
it
deems
the
new

violates

as

grew
who

became
one
of
the
questions
frequently
asked
on
the

jimmy
wales
once
argued
that
only
a
community
a
dedicated
group
of
a
few
hundred
volunteers
makes
the
bulk
of
contributions
to
wikipedia
and
that
the
project
is
therefore
much
like
any
traditional
organization113
in
2008
a
slate
magazine
article
reported
that
according
to
researchers
in
palo
alto
1
percent
of
wikipedia
users
are
responsible
for
about
half
of
the

edits114
this
method
of
evaluating
contributions
was
later
disputed
by
aaron
swartz
who
noted
that
several
articles
he
sampled
had
large
portions
of
their

measured
by
number
of
characters
contributed

said
that

contained
child

and
were
in

federal
obscenity
law213214
sanger
later
clarified
that
the
images
which
were
related
to
pedophilia
and
one
about
lolicon
were
not
of
real
children
but
said
that
they
constituted

visual
representations
of

of

that

bans

he

one
privacy
concern
in

two
of

the

at

the

all

the
gfdl
was
created
for

licensed
under

this
made
it
a
poor
choice
for

the

requires

2002
the

was
released
it
was
specifically
designed

in

not
just
for

the

gained
popularity
among

others
distributing

on

the

sought
the

because

were

in

deputy
director
of

stating
that
the

worry16
the

a
figure
substantially

of

and
the

one
principal
concern
cited

why
wikipedia
must
jettison
its
antielitism
kuro5hin
oped
there
is
a
certain
mindset
associated
with
unmoderated
usenet
groups
that
infects
the
collectivelymanaged
wikipedia
project
if
you
react
strongly
to
trolling
that
reflects
poorly
on
you
not
necessarily
on
the
troll
if
you
demand
that
something
be
done
about
constant
disruption
by
trollish
behavior
the
other
listmembers
will
cry
censorship
attack
you
and
even
come
to
the
defense
of
the
troll
the
root
problem
antielitism
or
lack
of
respect
for
expertise
there
is
a
deeper
problem
which
explains
both
of
the
aboveelaborated
problems
namely
as
a
community
wikipedia
lacks
the
habit
or
tradition
of
respect
for
expertise
as
a
community
far
from
being
elitist
it
is
antielitist
which
in
this
context
means
that
expertise
is
not
accorded
any
special
respect
and
snubs
and
disrespect
of
expertise
is
tolerated
this
is
one
of
my
failures
a
policy
that
i
attempted
to
institute
in
wikipedias
first
year
but
for
which
i
did
not
muster
adequate
support
was
the
policy
of
respecting
and
deferring
politely
to
experts
those
who
were
there
